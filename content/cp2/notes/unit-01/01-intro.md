## About Computer Programming 2

- Programming 2 is a more advanced course and is designed for students who intend to major
in computer science or a related discipline.
- The course is composed of two unique semesters:
  - Semester 1: Data Structures and Algorithms
  - Semester 2: Object-oriented Design and Development

## Abstraction

- "In computer science, **abstraction** is a technique for managing complexity of computer
systems. It works by establishing a level of complexity on which a person interacts with
the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science))
    - In Programming 1, we were operating at a very high level of abstraction
    - In Programming 2, we will be working at a lower level, at this level we are concerned
    with how data is stored in memory and algorithms to search and/or manipulate data.

## Data Structures

- A **data structure** is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so it can be used
efficiently [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)
- In Data Structures, we will implement
  - LinkedLists, Stacks, and Queues
  - Tree
  - Graphs

## Algorithms

- An **algorithm** is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed
- The algorithm we will develop are directly related to the above data structures
  - Searching and sorting algorithms for arrays and lists
  - Insertion and removal algorithms for lists and trees
  - Iteration and traversal algorithms for lists, tree, and graphs

## Tools of the Trade

### UNIX

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/UNIX-Licence-Plate.JPG)

- For a great overview of UNIX, see this reference
  - [UNIX tutorial](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)
- UNIX is an operating system made of 3 parts:
  - The **kernel** - core OS components including hardware interfacing, memory management, etc
  - The **shell** - command-line interface to navigate the file system, modify files, execute
  programs, etc
  - The **programs** - powerful command-line/graphical applications
- UNIX Philosophy
  - *Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together.
  Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.*

### Java/JVM

- General purpose, class based, object-oriented language with syntax based on C/C++
- Java
  - Developed in the early 90â€™s by Sun Microsystems
  - Initial release in June 1995
  - Virtual Machine based
  - Bytecode is executed by the JVM at close to the speed of native code generated by C/C++
