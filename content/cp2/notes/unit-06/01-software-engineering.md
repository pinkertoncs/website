## The Software Development Life Cycle

- **The systems development life cycle (SDLC)** is a conceptual model used in project
management that describes the stages involved in an information system development
project, from an initial feasibility study through maintenance of the completed application.

## Analysis and Design

- **Requirements analysis**, also called requirements engineering, is the process of
determining user expectations for a new or modified product. These features, called
requirements, must be quantifiable, relevant and detailed. In software engineering,
such requirements are often called **functional specifications**.

- **Object-oriented design** (OOD) is a design method in which a system is modeled as
a collection of cooperating objects and individual objects are treated as instances
of a class within a class hierarchy.

## Implementation and Testing

- **System implementation** is the practice of creating or modifying a **system** to create
a new business process or replace an existing business process.
- **Software testing** is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information
about the quality of the product or service under **test**.

## Maintenance and Evolution

- After a system has been deployed, it will undergo continual **maintenance** and/or
**evolution**, until such a time that it is discontinued, in which case it must be
**decommissioned**, and its data and/or functionality may need to be migrated to a new system.

## Waterfall v.s. Agile

- In **traditional development (waterfall model)**, each phase is "completed" before moving
onto the next phase.

- **Agile development** is an alternative to traditional project management where emphasis
is placed on empowering people to collaborate and make team decisions in addition to
continuous planning, continuous testing and continuous integration.
