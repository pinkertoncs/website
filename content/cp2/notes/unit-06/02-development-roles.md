## Stakeholders

- A **stakeholder** is someone who has a vested interest in the development of a project.
- There are typically three primary stakeholders in a software development project:
  - The **client** is an individual or business who contracts with a software development
  company to implement a product.
  - The **user** is the person or people who will actually use the product.
  - The **developer** is / are the company or individuals who are tasked with creating the product.
- Usually, the stakeholders have differing (often conflicting) interests.  For example:
  - The client and developer are very concerned with the **project budget and timeline**.
  - The user is concerned with **product usability and cost**.
  - The developer is concerned with the **maintainability** and **adaptability** of the product.
- The lines between these stakeholders are sometimes blurred.  For example:
  - The client might contract a developer to create a product that they will use in-house,
  in which case they are also the user.
  - The developer might create a product and market it directly to the users.
  - The developer might create a product that they intend to use in-house.
