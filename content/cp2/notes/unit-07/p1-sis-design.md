## Introduction

- Consider the following description of a SIS, taken from Wikipedia
    - "A **student information system** (SIS), **student management system**, **school administration software** or **student administration system** is a *management information system* for education establishments to manage student data. Student Information Systems (often abbreviated as SIS systems) provide capabilities for registering students on courses, documenting *grading transcripts* and results of student test and other *assessment scores*, build student schedules, track student attendance, and manage many other student-related data needs in a school. A SIS should not be confused with a *learning management system* or *virtual learning environment*, where course materials, assignments and assessment tests can be published electronically."
