title: "Enrichment 01 - FakeBook"
---

## Overview

- Create a layout that mimics facebook (or another **highly structured** page)

## Tips

- Check out this template to get started:
    - [Fakebook template](/template/cp1/fakebook/fakebook.html)
- Notes on template
    - Define an absolute width for the page - the page should not shrink or grow when you resize the browser window
    - Remember - you can **nest** divs and other content inside of other container divs.
- For search input, use:

    ```<input type='text' placeholder='Search...'/>```
- Here are many of the facebook icons

## Requirements

- Top bar should be fully replicated, each column should have main components in place
- Do not use screenshots unless you are capturing a specific image (for example, an icon)
- Do not worry about getting "pixel perfect", just get as close as you can in a reasonable amount of time

## Extension

- Research and use CSS3 @media queries to make your site a Responsive Web Design
