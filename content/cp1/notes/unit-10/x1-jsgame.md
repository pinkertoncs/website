---

## Directions
- Create a simple pong-like game, where you can use a paddle at the bottom of the screen
    to bounce the ball
- look back on previous demo code for a good starting point

## Hints
- Start with sample code
- Add a **paddle** object
- Define the appropriate event listeners in the **initialize** function
- Detect collisions between the paddles and the walls, and between the paddle and the ball,
  and respond accordingly

## Extensions (choose 1)

- Make a 2-player pong game with scoring
- Turn you game into a breakout clone. (Google it).
