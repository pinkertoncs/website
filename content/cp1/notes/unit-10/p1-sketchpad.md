title: "Project 01 - Sketchpad"
---

## Directions

- Create a drawing app where you move a 'pen' using the arrow keys
  - Refer back to the [Event handling](/cp1/notes/unit-09-04-event-handling) notes and your
  activities in the DOM worksheet

- Assign other keys to these tasks
  - clear the canvas
  - change the ball/pen color
  - change the ball/pen width

- Extensions (required)
  - Use a color input to select background and pen colors
  - Use a range input to select pen size
  - implement drawing with the mouse

- Tips:
  - Start with the animation code, but don't automatically update the position of the ball
  (do this with key presses) and don't automatically clear the canvas
