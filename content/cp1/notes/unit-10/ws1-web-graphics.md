## Objectives

- Use HTML5 Canvas to draw elements on a web page.
- Use JS timing to animate canvas elements.
- Use JS object-oriented programming to organize complex applications.

## Directions

- Create a web page to complete the exercises below.

## Canvas

1. What is the purpose of the ```<canvas>``` element?
2. Why should you use HTML height and width attributes instead of CSS to set the
dimensions of a canvas?
3. What is the canvas context?  How do you get the context from a canvas element with JS?
4. Show how to draw the following elements with JS:
   - line / path
   - rectangle
   - arc / circle
   - text
5. Show how to apply fill styles:
   - gradient
   - radial gradient
6. How can you clear the contents of a canvas?
7. Show how to load and draw an image to a canvas element.
8. What is a callback function?
9. What is the purpose of the imageObj.onload callback function?

## Timing and Animation

10. Compare the setInterval and setTimeout functions.
11. What is the time unit for JS timing?  How many milliseconds are in one second?
12. Use setInterval to log the current time to the console every second.
13. What is the purpose of the clearInterval and clearTimeout functions?
14. What is a 'draw loop.'
15. How can you set the FPS (frames per second) of an animation?
16. Finish the animation demo, so that the ball bounces off of all four boundaries of the canvas

## Object-oriented Programming

17. What is an object in programming?  How are they useful?
18. What is an object property?  What is an object method?
19. Give an code sample of a JS object literal with a few properties & methods.
20. What is the purpose of an object initialize function?
21. What is a class in programming?  What is a prototype in JavaScript?
22. How is a prototype used to construct new objects?  Demonstrate with code.
23. Compare & contrast object literals and prototypes.
