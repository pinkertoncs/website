<br />

**Computer Science** is ...

- **art** : "An expression or application of human creative skill and imagination"
- **science** : "The intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of
the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment."
and also, "a systematically organized body of knowledge on a particular subject"
- **engineering** : "Application of knowledge in order to invent, design, build, maintain, and improve structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes."

<br/>

**Computer Science** as a field includes the following components:

- **Theoretical CS** is the study of abstract and mathematical aspects of computing.
- **Applied CS** is the practice of using computers to solve real-world problems.
- Computer scientists must also consider **Social and Ethical** issues related to computers
and computing.

<br />

**Computer Programming** is a critical tool in Applied CS.

- **Computer Programming**, broadly speaking, includes the design and creation of
computer programs.

# Why Computer Science?

A few reasons ...

- Computers are becoming increasingly entwined with our lives.
- Many computer scientists find their jobs to be meaningful and personally fulfilling.
- The pay and the job outlook are great!

# Getting started with programming

## Code.org

Code.org is a non-profit aimed at increasing participation in computer science

- [code.org](http://code.org/learn)
  - Home of the "Hour of Code" (uses Blockly)
  - Many other resources!

## Visual Programming

Visual programming editors use **blocks** which are like puzzle-pieces that click together
to determine how a program works.

The following were mostly developed by Google and/or MIT

- [Blockly games](https://blockly-games.appspot.com/) / [demos](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/)
  - "Blockly is a web-based, graphical programming editor. Users can drag blocks together
  to build an application. No typing required."
- [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) / [Snap!](http://snap.berkeley.edu/)
  - "Scratch is a free programming language and online community where you can create your
  own interactive stories, games, and animations."
  - "[Snap is an extension of Scratch...] suitable for a serious introduction to computer
  science for high school or college students."
- [App Inventor](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/)
  - Use Blockly to make Android apps!

## Text-Based Programming

Try some more traditional programming

- [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)
  - Wed design with HTML/CSS
  - Programming with JavaScript, Python, and more!
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/cs)
  - Focuses on drawing with HTML5 and JavaScript.
