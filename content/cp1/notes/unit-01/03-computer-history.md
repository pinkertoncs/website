# Early History

## People

- Before machines took over the job, people who did counting and arithmetic were known as
computers.

## Simple Calculating tools

- Early tools used basic principles of counting and number representation (base 10 numbers).
- They were more of a "memory-aid" for human computers than a computer in any modern sense
of the word.

# Difference Engine

- Charles Babbage (1791 - 1871)
  - Conceived and designed the first computer in anything like the modern sense.
- Ada Lovelace (1815 - 1852)
  - worked out algorithms that were to be carried out by the DE - she  is often recognized as
  the world's first computer programmer.
- Difference Engine
  - Not built until 1991 (for historical purposes)
  - Operate by turning a crank, produces tables for polynomial functions
- Analytical Engine
  - Conceived by Babbage as successor of D.E.
  - "General purpose" - precursor to modern computers

# Early 'Modern' Computers

## **Core Technologies**

- Mechanical v.s. Electronic
  - Strictly **mechanical** devices use non-electrical energy, for example water flow,
  steam, human or animal power, etc.
  - **Electromechanical** devices use electricity to power mechanical components
  (components that move)
  - Strictly **electrical** devices do not have moving parts.
- Switches
  - A **switch** either allows electrical current to flow from A to B (on) or restricts
  the current current (off). Just think of a light switch.
  - **Relay** electromechanical

  - **Vacuum Tube** solid state

## Early electronic computers

- There are several candidates for the title of "World's First Modern Computer," and the
answer depends on how you define "Modern Computer."

# Personal Computers

- Significant advancements in the 40's and 50's allowed for the size and cost of computers
to drop significantly, paving the way for computers to come to the office and home.

## Transistors & Integrated circuits

- Use:
  - Transistors can be used as switches.
  - Cheaper, smaller, and more energy efficient than vacuum tubes.
  - <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Transistorer_%28cropped%29.jpg'
  width='60%'>
- Development
  - 1948 - Invented at Bell Telephone Laboratories
  - 1954 - First silicon transistor, George Teal, Texas Instruments
  - 1956 - Inventors Shockley, Bardeen, and Brattain win Nobel Prize in Physics
- Integrated circuits
  - 1958 - Independently invented by Jack Kilby, TI and Robert Noyce, Fairchild Semiconductors
  - <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Microchips.jpg/1280px-Microchips.jpg' width='60%'>

<br/>

## Moore's Law

- *Cramming more components onto integrated circuits* (1965)
- Density of transistors on a chip doubles about every two years.
- Observation vs. "law"
- In effect, computers get faster, smaller, cheaper

# Personal and Portable Computers

# Trends and Projections

- Trends
  - Moore's law: smaller, cheaper, more powerful.
  - "Aware": can sense information from surroundings
  - Expressive: can represent real-world data in more powerful ways
  - Connected: connected with people, places, and things.

## Smaller, Cheaper, and more Powerful
- Computers have evolved rapidly since the first generation in the early 40's

<br/>

## More connected and Expressive

- The Internet & WWW connect devices and people (more on this in later notes)
- Sensors and robotics allow computers to interact with the world in completely new ways
all the time.

## Projections

- Computers could actually overtake human brainpower (and sooner than you might imagine)!
