title: "Enrichment 01 - Interactive Turtle"
---
## Overview

- Use turtle event handling to create a program that allows the user to draw using the keyboard and/or mouse
- There is some starter code here
    - [Think CS Ch. 10: Event-driven programming](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/events.html)
    - **NOTE to make the starter code work in repl.it**:
      - delete line 3: ```turtle.setup(400,500)```
      - delete line 5: ```wn.title("Handling keypresses!")```

- On the [turtle graphics reference](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/turtle.html), see sections on
    - Using events
    - Using screen events


## Features

- Basic (in the start code already)
    - use the arrow keys to move the turtle
    - use the U and D keys to do a penup or pendown
- Mouse movement
    - click-and-drag the move the turtle
    - click anywhere on the screen to move the turtle to that location
- Turtle attributes
    - use the RGB keys to set the color to red, green, blue respectively
    - use the +/- keys to increase or decrease the pen width (use the num pad for testing)
