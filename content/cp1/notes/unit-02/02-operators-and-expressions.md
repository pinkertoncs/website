## Comments

Every program should contain **comments** or notes in the code.

A comment begins with a **#** (number sign, pound symbol, hashtag), and anything from the **#** to the end of line the is not executed.

A Multiline comment begins and ends with triple quotes **'''**

### Examples

```python
# This is a single line comment
```

```python
'''
This is
a
multiline



comment'''
```

## Operators

Basic mathematical operators

- addition **+**
- subtraction **-**
- multiplication **\***
- division **/**

Other math operators

- powers **a \*\* b**
    - **a** raised to the **b** power
- floor division **a // b**
    - divide **a** by **b** and round down
- modulo operator **a % b**
    - returns the remainder of **a** divided by **b**

## Expressions

Expressions are the result of combining literals and operators. They do not produce a result in the script, but have a **return value** (or the answer of the expression is "provided" to the programmer).

### Examples

```python
1 + 2 # expression with the value 3
```

```python
2 ** 3 # the expression with the value 8
```
