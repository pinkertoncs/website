title: "Lesson 04 - Strings"

As we have previously learned, a **string** is a sequence of characters.
String can be short or long (as seen below)


```python
"hi"
"Hello World"
"This is a very long string!"
```

Just like numbers, there are operations that can be performed on strings.

- concatenation **a + b**
    - joins the strings **a** and **b** into one string
- repetition **a \* x**
    - repeats the string **a**, **x** times

## Examples

```python
'Hello' + "World"
# expression with value "HelloWorld"

'hi' * 5
# expression with value 'hihihihihi'
```
