- An **int** is an integer value
    - positive and negative whole numbers, and zero

- A **float** is a floating point value (decimal number)
- A **character** is a single letter, digit, or other symbol
- A **string** is a sequence of characters

In Python, **literals** are single data values, e.g. a single value of type int, float, string, etc.

## Examples

```python
1      # int
5.672  # float
'a'    # character
"asdf" # string
```
