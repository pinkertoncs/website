In the most basic terms, variables are programmer defined named memory locations that hold data.

## Terminology

- **Statements** are composed of expressions and produce results is a python program. Most lines of code are statements

- A **variable assignment** statement assigns the value of the right-hand side (RHS) to the variable on the left-hand side (LHS)

- If a variable is new, this is called **defining** or **initializing** the variable.

- If a variable has been previously been initialized, this is call **reassignment**

## Examples

```python
x = 5
#assign variable from literal

y = x + 1
# assign variable from expression
# (y is now 6)

y = y + 2
# update y using it's original value
# (y is now 8)

y += 2
# shorthand for  previous statement
# (y is now 10)
```
