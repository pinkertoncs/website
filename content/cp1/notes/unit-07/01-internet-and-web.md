## Computer Networks

A **computer network** is a collection of computers that can transfer data between one another.

In a basic **client-server** network

- Computers are connected via a central **server**.
- Each computer connected to the server is a **client**.

### The Internet

- Networks are linked together to create **internetworks, or internets**.
- One of the first internetworks was ARPANET, which went online in 1969
- The globally connected internetworks is called **the Internet** (with a capital 'I')

### ISP and home networks

- Consumers connect to the Internet through an **Internet Service Provider (ISP)**
  - For example: Comcast or Verizon
  - An ISP forms a **wide-area network (WAN)**
- Many homes now have a **local-area network (LAN)**
  - A **modem** connects the LAN to an ISP
  - A **router** directs Internet traffic to and from devices on the LAN

## The WWW

- 'The web' refers to the World Wide Web (WWW)
- The WWW went online in 1991
- Components of the WWW
  - **Web Server**
  - **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**
  - **Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)**
  - **Web Browsers**

### Web Servers and HTTP

- When you attempt to access content on the WWW
  - your computer (**client**) sends a request over the Internet to a **server** for the website
  - The server then sends back a **response** with the date you requested

### Emergent and future technologies

- The "semantic web"
  - using metadata to provide extra information about web content
  - ```#``` hashtags are a form on semantic tagging
- The "Internet of Things
  - connecting other items to the web: cars, household appliances, clothing, etc.
- Virtual/Augmented reality
  - e.g. oculus right, Google Glasses, etc
  - VR/AR  technologies provide new ways to interact with the web and with each other via. the web.
- Artificially Intelligent (AI) Agents
  - entities which can act autonomously on your behalf.
  - AI agents will be able to observe the world and will have 'senses,' such as vision (image recognition), hearing (audio / natural language processing), and more.
