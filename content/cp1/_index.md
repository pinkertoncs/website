## Course Description

This full-year (1 credit) course introduces students to the philosophy, theory, and practice of computer science. Students examine possibilities and implications of computer technology, tenets of computation and algorithms, and the design and development of software applications. A hands-on and team-oriented approach is emphasized, and various desktop and web-based software will be used to support learning and collaboration. Primary programming topics include: syntax and semantics, control flow, data structures, modules, objects and classes. Students will create both interpreted and compiled programs, and will have the opportunity to earn college credit through Running Start.
