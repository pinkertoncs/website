<h2 id="the-software-development-life-cycle">The Software Development Life Cycle</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>The systems development life cycle (SDLC)</strong> is a conceptual model used in project
management that describes the stages involved in an information system development
project, from an initial feasibility study through maintenance of the completed application.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="analysis-and-design">Analysis and Design</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Requirements analysis</strong>, also called requirements engineering, is the process of
determining user expectations for a new or modified product. These features, called
requirements, must be quantifiable, relevant and detailed. In software engineering,
such requirements are often called <strong>functional specifications</strong>.

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Object-oriented design</strong> (OOD) is a design method in which a system is modeled as
a collection of cooperating objects and individual objects are treated as instances
of a class within a class hierarchy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implementation-and-testing">Implementation and Testing</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>System implementation</strong> is the practice of creating or modifying a <strong>system</strong> to create
a new business process or replace an existing business process.</li>
<li><strong>Software testing</strong> is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information
about the quality of the product or service under <strong>test</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="maintenance-and-evolution">Maintenance and Evolution</h2>

<ul>
<li>After a system has been deployed, it will undergo continual <strong>maintenance</strong> and/or
<strong>evolution</strong>, until such a time that it is discontinued, in which case it must be
<strong>decommissioned</strong>, and its data and/or functionality may need to be migrated to a new system.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="waterfall-v-s-agile">Waterfall v.s. Agile</h2>

<ul>
<li>In <strong>traditional development (waterfall model)</strong>, each phase is &ldquo;completed&rdquo; before moving
onto the next phase.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://www.asahitechnologies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Waterfall.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Agile development</strong> is an alternative to traditional project management where emphasis
is placed on empowering people to collaborate and make team decisions in addition to
continuous planning, continuous testing and continuous integration.</li>
</ul>
